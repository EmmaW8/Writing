# Writing for Computer Science

>  A summary.        created on 14th May 2018 by sjwang.



[TOC]

Do not use the word unclear.

## Orgnization. 

- Describe the work in an accepted scientific knowledge.

- State the idea that is being investigated.

- Explain what is new about the idea, what is being evaluated, or what contribution the paper is making.

- Justify the theory, by methods such as proof or experiment.

  

## Title and Author

- Use the same style for your name on all your papers.
- Titles of papers and sections should be concise and informative, have specific rather than general terms, and accurately describe the content. Complicated titles with long words are hard to digest.

## Abstract

- length 50-200 words.

- Function: allow readers to judge whether or not the paper is of relevance to them.

- Five-element organization

  1. ***Background*** A general statement introducing the broad research area of the particular topic being investigated.    
  2. ***Importance*** An explanation of the specific problem (**difficulty, obstacle, challenge** ) to be solved.
  3.  ***Others work*** A review of existing or standard solutions to this problem and their limitations.
  4.  ***Your work*** An outline of the proposed new solution. 
  5.  ***Your results*** A summary of how the solution was evaluated and what the outcomes of the evaluation were.

  Five sentences are enough, one for each of the points above.

## Introduction

An expanded version of the abstract, but with a paragraph or two, not a sentence, for each component.

[**topic, problem, references to key papers, approach, solution, limitations, outcomes.**]

- Motivation: 
  1. why the problem is interesting
  2. what the relevant scientific issues are
  3. why the approach taken is a good one, and why the outcomes are significant.
- The reader should understand the scope of the work, and of the problem and the contribution.

## Body

## Conclusions

Write "**Conslusions**" not "conclusion".

**important results** && **their significance** && **limitations**

**Future work** look beyond the current context.

## The first draft

> The writing should begin as soon as the research is started. 

**In a logical structure**,  may not elegant, can write freely.

Mathematical content, definitions, and the problem statement should be made precise as early as possible.

## From Draft to Submission

Introduction—>Body—>Summary—>Introduction—>Abstract

For a novice writer who doesn’t know where to begin, a good starting point is imitation. Choose a paper or thesis whose results are of a similar flavour to your own, analyze its organization, and sketch an organization for your results based on the same pattern. The habit of using similar patterns for papers—their standardization—helps to make them easier to read. 

## Good Style

- Economy 

  convey information without unnecessary dressing. 

  *Be **egoless**—ready to dislike anything you have previously written. Expect to revise several times, perhaps many times.*

- Tone. Use we or I.

  Science writing should be objective and accurate.

  - Have one idea per sentence or paragraph and one topic per section. 
  - Have a straightforward, logical organization.
  - Use short words.
  - Use short sentences with simple structure. 
  -  Keep paragraphs short.
  -  Avoid buzzwords, clichés, and slang.
  -  Avoid excess, in length or style.
  -  Omit unnecessary material.
  -  Be specific, not vague or abstract.
  -  Break these rules if there is a good reason to do so. 

- Examples

- Motivation

  Link text together as a narrative—each section should have a clear story to tell. The connection between one paragraph and the next should be obvious. This principle is sometimes expressed as: Tell the reader what you are going to say, then say it, and then tell the reader that you have said it. 

  Motivate the reader at each major step in the exposition: explain **how** a definition (theorem, lemma, whatever) is to be used, or **why** it is interesting, or **how** it fits into the overall plan. 

  Motivation is essential, but do motivate the right thing. Don’t, say, set the scene by explaining that certain algorithms are too slow for massive databases, and then test your method on a few thousand records; or argue that “Web search needs to be semantically aware” and then propose the use of spelling correction to amend queries. The big-picture topic may well be the inspiration for your overall work, but that does not mean that it is necessarily the right inspiration for a particular paper. 

- Voice

  Avoid excessive use of indirect statements (passive voice), particularly descriptions of actions that don’t indicate who or what performs them. 

  “achieved”, “carried out”, “conducted”, “done”, “occurred”, and “effected”. 

- Straw men

  A straw man is an indefensible hypothesis that an author describes for the sole purpose of criticizing it.  

  **We believe that** most users prefer the graphical style of interface. 

  - Avoid nonsense, absurdity, and over-generalization. 

    The Web is **infinitely** large.  

  - If there is evidence—a study or proof, not someone else’s opinion—then cite it. Unsubstantiated claims should be clearly noted as such, not dressed up as accepted knowledge. 

    Another possibility would be a disk-based method, but **our experience suggests that** this approach is unlikely to be successful. 

- Reference and Citation 

  You need to explain the relationship of your new work to existing work, showing how your work builds on previous knowledge and how it differs from contributions in other, relevant papers. 		

  When discussing a reference with more than two authors, all but the first author’s name can be replaced by “et al.”
